# 2. ReactNative for mobile application

Date: 2020-02-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on which language and framework we will use for the mobile application.

## Decision

We will use ReactNative and JavaScript to develop our mobile application. Majority of our team members feel comfortable using JavaScript and have experience using ReactNative.

## Consequences

Our mobile application will be built using ReactNative and JS. We need to setup all the tooling for this framework and language, including our CI/CD server. We need to document how to setup a developer's machine.
