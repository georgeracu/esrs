# 4. Android first

Date: 2020-02-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to focus on building the mobile application for one platform first. This is required as the two major mobile OS providers (iOS and Android) have different APIs and different requirements in publishing an application. We need to choose one for now.

## Decision

We will use Android as our first mobile platform to build on. This is due to easy of use and previous experience on using Android.

## Consequences

Our development setup and our CI/CD pipeline needs to be focused on Android first. We need to setup our Google Play account.
