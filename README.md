# ESRS project

_Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand._ Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review.

## We are Agile

### Prime Directive

We use the Prime Directive as the base for an empathic and respectful conversation in our communication inside the team. More details can be found in this [blog post](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/applying-prime-directive-beyond-retrospective)

### Agile Values

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

- [Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
- [Principles - must read](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

## Tooling

Bellow we have a list of the tools we use and their role.

### Slack

We use Slack as our main communication channel. Our slack workspace is [esrs sussex](https://esrssussex.slack.com). A few channels to join are `esrs`, `announcements`, `general` and `polls`. Currently Slack has integrated GitHub and Trello.

### GitHub

We use it for hosting our repository. For any new PR or merge to master, a new notification is sent to Slack in `announcements`. All commits to GitHub needs to be signed with PGP key.

### Trello

We use it for task management. We have a Kanban board where we track our work. It is integrated with GitHub such that you can reference commits into a task and with Slack such that you can update/create tasks from Slack.
