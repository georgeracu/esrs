# 3. Python and Flask as our backend language and framework

Date: 2020-02-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on which language and framework we will use for the backend services.

## Decision

We will use Python and Flask to develop our backend services. Majority of our team members feel comfortable using Python and have experience using Flask. We all agreed that Python is more suitable for manipulating large sets of data.

## Consequences

Our backend services will be built using Python and Flask. We need to setup all the tooling for this framework and language, including our CI/CD server. We need to document how to setup a developer's machine.
